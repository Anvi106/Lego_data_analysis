# Lego_data_analysis
I have analyzed Lego data set with the help of pandas and matpltlib

Here are the few things that I have analyzed in my google collaboratory:

1.What was the largest LEGO set ever made, and how many pieces did it contain?

2.How did the LEGO corporation get its start? How many LEGO sets were sold when the company initially began, and what year were the first LEGO sets released?

3.The most sets are found in which LEGO theme? Is it one of LEGO's original themes, like as Ninjago, or a licenced one, such as Harry Potter or Marvel Superheroes?

4.When did the LEGO Corporation actually broaden the range of its products? Based on how many themes and sets the company issued year over year, can we detect a change in its business strategy?

5.Has the size and complexity of LEGO kits increased over time? Are there more or fewer parts in older LEGO sets than in modern sets on average?
