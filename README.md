# Programming_languages_data_analysis

I have analyzed stack overflow data set on Programming Language with the help of pandas and matpltlib

key things done to analyse the popularity of different programming languages over time in this project are:

1. Visualised data and create charts with Matplotlib

2. Pivoted, grouped and manipulated the data with Pandas to get it into the format you want

3. Work with timestamps and time-series data

4. Styled and customised a line chart
